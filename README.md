# phishing-detection
AI-Powered Phishing Detection Script

Overview

This project develops a machine learning-based phishing detection system using Python and a Naive Bayes classifier to identify phishing emails. Built in a Kali Linux VM, it integrates my cybersecurity skills (vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, incident response, threat detection) and AI knowledge from the IBM Explore Emerging Tech program. This repository mirrors the professional structure of my DMZ network security project.


Step 1: Development Environment Setup

Environment: Kali Linux VM (VirtualBox, version 2025.2).

Tools Installed:

Python 3, pip, Git (sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git -y).
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

(sudo apt install python3-pandas python3-numpy python3-sklearn python3-matplotlib python3-seaborn -y).


Project Directory: /home/kali/phishing-detection with Git initialized.

Tool Verification: (![install-verification](screenshots/install_verification.png))

Library Installation: (![Libararies_install](screenshots/libraries_installation.png))

Project Directory: (![project-directory](screenshots/creating_project_directory.png))

Library Verification Setup: (![verifying-library](screenshots/libraries_installation_verified.png))




Step 2: Obtain a Dataset

Dataset: Enron Phishing Dataset downloaded from [https://labs-repos.iit.demokritos.gr/balab/mails.php](https://labs-repos.iit.demokritos.gr/balab/mails.php) on July 30, 2025.
Details: Contains phishing and legitimate emails for training the Naive Bayes model.
