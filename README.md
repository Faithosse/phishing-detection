# phishing-detection
AI-Powered Phishing Detection Script
Overview
This project develops a machine learning-based phishing detection system using Python and a Naive Bayes classifier to identify phishing emails. Built in a Kali Linux VM, it integrates my cybersecurity skills (vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, incident response, threat detection) and AI knowledge from the IBM Explore Emerging Tech program. This repository mirrors the professional structure of my DMZ network security project.
